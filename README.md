# Flappy_bird_game-Opencv
This is a simple game made using the opencv library for taking continuous video input and finding the position of the finger and move the bird in the game according to that.

You need to install the dependent libraries for it and then simply run the main.py file.
Make sure a working camera is there in the computer or you have linked your phone's camera to the laptop.

Nothing else is expected from the user, and the game will run smoothly.

## ENJOY :)
